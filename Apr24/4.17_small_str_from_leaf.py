    988. Smallest String Starting From Leaf
    https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-string-starting-from-leaf/

    You are given the root of a binary tree where each node has a value in the range [0, 25] representing the letters 'a' to 'z'.

    Return the lexicographically smallest string that starts at a leaf of this tree and ends at the root.

    As a reminder, any shorter prefix of a string is lexicographically smaller.

        - For example, "ab" is lexicographically smaller than "aba".

    A leaf of a node is a node that has no children.
