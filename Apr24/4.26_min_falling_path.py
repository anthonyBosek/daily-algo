    1289. Minimum Falling Path Sum II
    https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-falling-path-sum-ii/

    Given an n x n integer matrix grid, return the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts.

    A falling path with non-zero shifts is a choice of exactly one element from each row of grid such
        that no two elements chosen in adjacent rows are in the same column.
