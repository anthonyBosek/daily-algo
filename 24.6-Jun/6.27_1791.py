    1791. Find Center of Star Graph
    https://leetcode.com/problems/find-center-of-star-graph/

    There is an undirected star graph consisting of n nodes labeled from 1 to n.
    A star graph is a graph where there is one center node and exactly n - 1 edges
    that connect the center node with every other node.

    You are given a 2D integer array edges where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates
    that there is an edge between the nodes ui and vi. Return the center of the
    given star graph.
