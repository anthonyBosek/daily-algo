    2037. Minimum Number of Moves to Seat Everyone
    https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-moves-to-seat-everyone/

    There are n seats and n students in a room. You are given an array seats of length n,
    where seats[i] is the position of the ith seat. You are also given the array students
    of length n, where students[j] is the position of the jth student.

    You may perform the following move any number of times:

        â€¢ Increase or decrease the position of the ith student by 1
            (i.e., moving the ith student from position x to x + 1 or x - 1)

    Return the minimum number of moves required to move each student to a seat such that no two students are in the same seat.

    **Note that there may be multiple seats or students in the same position at the beginning.
