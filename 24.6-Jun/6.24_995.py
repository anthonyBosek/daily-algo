    995. Minimum Number of K Consecutive Bit Flips
    https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-k-consecutive-bit-flips/

    You are given a binary array nums and an integer k.

    A k-bit flip is choosing a subarray of length k from nums and simultaneously changing every 0
    in the subarray to 1, and every 1 in the subarray to 0.

    Return the minimum number of k-bit flips required so that there is no 0 in the array.
    If it is not possible, return -1.

    A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.
