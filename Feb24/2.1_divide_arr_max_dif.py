    2966. Divide Array Into Arrays With Max Difference
    https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-array-into-arrays-with-max-difference/

    You are given an integer array nums of size n and a positive integer k.

    Divide the array into one or more arrays of size 3 satisfying the following conditions:
     - Each element of nums should be in exactly one array.
     - The difference between any two elements in one array is less than or equal to k.

    Return a 2D array containing all the arrays. If it is impossible to satisfy the conditions,
        return an empty array. And if there are multiple answers, return any of them.
