    2678. Number of Senior Citizens
    https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-senior-citizens/

    You are given a 0-indexed array of strings details. Each element of details provides information
    about a given passenger compressed into a string of length 15. The system is such that:

        â€¢ The first ten characters consist of the phone number of passengers.
        â€¢ The next character denotes the gender of the person.
        â€¢ The following two characters are used to indicate the age of the person.
        â€¢ The last two characters determine the seat allotted to that person.

    Return the number of passengers who are strictly more than 60 years old.

    #     phone_number = passenger[0:9]
    #     gender = passenger[10]
