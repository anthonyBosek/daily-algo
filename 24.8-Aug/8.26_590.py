    590. N-ary Tree Postorder Traversal
    https://leetcode.com/problems/n-ary-tree-postorder-traversal/

    Given the root of an n-ary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

    Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal.
    Each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples)
