    703. Kth Largest Element in a Stream
    https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-a-stream/

    Design a class to find the kth largest element in a stream. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

    Implement KthLargest class:

        â€¢ KthLargest(int k, int[] nums) Initializes the object with the integer k and the stream of integers nums.
        â€¢ int add(int val) Appends the integer val to the stream and returns the element representing the kth largest element in the stream.

class KthLargest:

    def __init__(self, k: int, nums: List[int]):
        pass

    def add(self, val: int) -> int:
        pass
