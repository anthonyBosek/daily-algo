    https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-score-from-removing-substrings/

    You are given a string s and two integers x and y. You can perform two types of operations any number of times.

        1. Remove substring "ab" and gain x points.
        For example, when removing "ab" from "cabxbae" it becomes "cxbae".

        2. Remove substring "ba" and gain y points.
        For example, when removing "ba" from "cabxbae" it becomes "cabxe".

    Return the maximum points you can gain after applying the above operations on s.
