    1110. Delete Nodes And Return Forest
    https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-nodes-and-return-forest/

    Given the root of a binary tree, each node in the tree has a distinct value.

    After deleting all nodes with a value in to_delete, we are left with a forest (a disjoint union of trees).

    Return the roots of the trees in the remaining forest. You may return the result in any order.
