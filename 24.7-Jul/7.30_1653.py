    1653. Minimum Deletions to Make String Balanced
    https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-deletions-to-make-string-balanced/

    You are given a string s consisting only of characters 'a' and 'b'​​​​.

    You can delete any number of characters in s to make s balanced. s is balanced if there
    is no pair of indices (i,j) such that i < j and s[i] = 'b' and s[j]= 'a'.

    Return the minimum number of deletions needed to make s balanced.
