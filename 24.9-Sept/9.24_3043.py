    3043. Find the Length of the Longest Common Prefix
    https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-length-of-the-longest-common-prefix/

    You are given two arrays with positive integers arr1 and arr2.

    A prefix of a positive integer is an integer formed by one or more of its digits,
    starting from its leftmost digit. For example, 123 is a prefix of the integer 12345,
    while 234 is not.

    A common prefix of two integers a and b is an integer c, such that c is a prefix of both a and b.
    For example, 5655359 and 56554 have a common prefix 565 while 1223 and 43456 do not have a common prefix.

    You need to find the length of the longest common prefix between all pairs of integers (x, y)
    such that x belongs to arr1 and y belongs to arr2.

    Return the length of the longest common prefix among all pairs. If no common prefix exists among them, return 0.
