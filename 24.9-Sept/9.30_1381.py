    1381. Design a Stack With Increment Operation
    https://leetcode.com/problems/design-a-stack-with-increment-operation/

    Design a stack that supports increment operations on its elements.

    Implement the CustomStack class:

        • CustomStack(int maxSize) Initializes the object with maxSize which is
            the maximum number of elements in the stack.

        • void push(int x) Adds x to the top of the stack if the stack has not
            reached the maxSize.

        • int pop() Pops and returns the top of the stack or -1 if the stack is empty.

        • void inc(int k, int val) Increments the bottom k elements of the stack by val.
            If there are less than k elements in the stack, increment all the elements
            in the stack.

class CustomStack:

    def __init__(self, maxSize: int):
        pass

    def push(self, x: int) -> None:
        pass

    def pop(self) -> int:
        pass

    def increment(self, k: int, val: int) -> None:
        pass


# Your CustomStack object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = CustomStack(maxSize)
# obj.push(x)
# param_2 = obj.pop()
# obj.increment(k,val)
