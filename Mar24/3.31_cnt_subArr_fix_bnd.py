    2444. Count Subarrays With Fixed Bounds
    https://leetcode.com/problems/count-subarrays-with-fixed-bounds/

    You are given an integer array nums and two integers minK and maxK.

    A fixed-bound subarray of nums is a subarray that satisfies the following conditions:

    â€¢ The minimum value in the subarray is equal to minK.
    â€¢ The maximum value in the subarray is equal to maxK.

    Return the number of fixed-bound subarrays.

    A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

class Solution:
    def countSubarrays(self, nums: List[int], minK: int, maxK: int) -> int:
        pass
