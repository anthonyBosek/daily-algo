    621. Task Scheduler
    https://leetcode.com/problems/task-scheduler/

    You are given an array of CPU tasks, each represented by letters A to Z, and a cooling time, n. Each
        cycle or interval allows the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's
        a constraint: identical tasks must be separated by at least n intervals due to cooling time.

    â€‹Return the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks.
