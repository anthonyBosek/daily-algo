    791. Custom Sort String
    https://leetcode.com/problems/custom-sort-string/

    You are given two strings order and s. All the characters of order are unique
        and were sorted in some custom order previously.

    Permute the characters of s so that they match the order that order was sorted.
        More specifically, if a character x occurs before a character y in order,
        then x should occur before y in the permuted string.

    Return any permutation of s that satisfies this property.
