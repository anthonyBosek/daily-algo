    1404. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number in Binary Representation to One
    https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-steps-to-reduce-a-number-in-binary-representation-to-one/

    Given the binary representation of an integer as a string s, return the number of steps to reduce it to 1 under the following rules:

        • If the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2.

        • If the current number is odd, you have to add 1 to it.

    It is guaranteed that you can always reach one for all test cases.
