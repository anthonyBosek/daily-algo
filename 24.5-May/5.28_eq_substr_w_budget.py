    1208. Get Equal Substrings Within Budget
    https://leetcode.com/problems/get-equal-substrings-within-budget/

    You are given two strings s and t of the same length and an integer maxCost.

    You want to change s to t. Changing the ith character of s to ith character of t costs |s[i] - t[i]|
    (i.e., the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters).

    Return the maximum length of a substring of s that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding
    substring of t with a cost less than or equal to maxCost. If there is no substring from s that can be
    changed to its corresponding substring from t, return 0.

class Solution:
    def equalSubstring(self, s: str, t: str, maxCost: int) -> int:
        pass
